## Developing
Please, feel free to fork this repository and add support for your OS. It will greatly help developers who prefer another OS / Platforms. I' am not doing this myself because I found that using prebuilt custom Ubuntu repository makes usage of this script endlessly faster with less head pain then trying to define why Nginx package is not compiling from the source code on another particular OS / Platform.
